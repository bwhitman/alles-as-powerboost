# alles is a dumb (but great) powerboost   

If you don't have an Adafruit style powerboost board around, or they're severely backordered (like now), an [Alles PCB](https://github.com/bwhitman/alles) works great as a Powerboost. It supports lipo charging, 5V output, switches from wall power to battery power seamlessly and has a soft on-off switch for the 5V. very nice! 

This is a repo i use when I need a powerboost and have more Alles PCBs than powerboosts around. prints battery status every few seconds to the UART, you can parse that on your MCU if you want!
